		<h2>Client-side Key Generation and Encryption</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Requirements</h3>
			You will need to import a library (or libraries) that includes the algorithms:
			<ul>
				<li>SHA-256</li>
				<li>AES with CBC mode.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<hr>
		<div>
			<h3>Insertion</h3>
			The app should take three user input fields for the insertion process:
			<ol>
				<li>Vessel image</li>
				<li>Content file</li>
				<li>Password</li>
			</ol>
			(After the vessel image is selected, it would probably be good to call the get_capacity	API function and display that
			data somehow so that the user knows how much they can fit in their image.)
			<br><br>
			Once all of the inputs are set and the user clicks the button to insert, the client and server keys should be generated with this schema:
			<br>
			<center>
				<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='docs/keygen_scheme.png') }}">
			</center>
			<ol>
				<li>The password is hashed with SHA-256 to generate the preliminary hash (should be stored as a hex digest string)</li>
				<li>The preliminary hash is split down the middle into two strings.
					A 256-bit hex string should have 64 characters, so you should have two strings of 32 characters.</li>
				<li>The original password and the first half of the hash are concatenated together and hashed to produce the server-side key.</li>
				<li>The original password and the second half of the hash are concatenated together and hashed to produce the client-side key.</li>
			</ol>
			Once you have implemented the function to generate these keys, you can go
			<a href="/docs/password_tester">here</a> to test passwords and see the output keys.
			Make sure the keys that show up in the password tester match the ones that are produced by your implementation.
			<br>
			Once both keys are generated, the content file should be encrypted with this schema:
			<br>
			<center>
				<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='docs/encrypt_scheme.png') }}">
			</center>
			<ol>
				<li>With a random number generator of your choice (a secure one is probably best) generate a 16-byte sequence for your initialization vector</li>
				<li>Using the client key and IV, encrypt the content file with AES in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.</li>
				<li>Prepend the 16 IV bytes to the encrypted content file so that they are the first 16 bytes of the file</li>
			</ol>
			After all this is done, send the vessel image, server key, and encrypted content to the insert API fuction.
			Upon success you will get a response with a link to an image on the website.  This image will have the encrypted content file embedded inside.
		</div>
		<hr>
		<div>
			<h3>Extraction</h3>
			For extraction the app should only take two inputs:
			<ol>
				<li>Vessel image (with file embedded in it)</li>
				<li>Password</li>
			</ol>
			Once the image and password are set and the user clicks the button to extract, the server and client keys should be generated with
			the same schema as the insertion process.  Save the client key and just send the image and the server key to the extract API function.
			If successful you should get back an encrypted file which should be decrypted using this schema:
			<br>
			<center>
				<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='docs/decrypt_scheme.png') }}">
			</center>
			<ol>
				<li>The first 16 bytes of the encrypted file should be split from the rest of the file data and used as the IV</li>
				<li>Use the IV and the client key to decrypt the content file (again using AES in CBC mode).</li>
			</ol>
			And then you're done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
