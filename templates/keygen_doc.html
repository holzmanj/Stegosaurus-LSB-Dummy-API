		<h2>Client-side Key Generation and Encryption</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Requirements</h3>
			You will need to import a library (or libraries) that includes the algorithms:
			<ul>
				<li>SHA-256</li>
				<li>AES with CBC mode.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<hr>
		<div>
			<h3>Insertion</h3>
			The app should take three user input fields for the insertion process:
			<ol>
				<li>Vessel image</li>
				<li>Content file</li>
				<li>Password</li>
			</ol>
			(After the vessel image is selected, it would probably be good to call the
			<a href="https://stegosaurus.ml/api/">get_capacity</a>
			API function and display that data somehow so that the user knows how much they can fit in their image.)
			<br><br>
			Once all of the inputs are set and the user clicks the button to insert, the client and server keys should be generated with this schema:
			<br>
			<center>
				<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='docs/keygen_scheme.png') }}">
			</center>
			<ol>
				<li>The password is hashed with SHA-256 to generate the preliminary hash (should be stored as a hex digest string)</li>
				<li>The preliminary hash is split down the middle into two strings.  A 256-bit hex string should have 64 characters, so you should have two strings of 32 characters.</li>
				<li>The original password and the first half of the hash are concatenated together and hashed to produce the server-side key.</li>
				<li>The original password and the second half of the hash are concatenated together and hashed to produce the client-side key.</li>
			</ol>
			Once you have implemented the function to generate these keys, you can go
			<a href="/docs/password_tester">here</a> to test passwords and see the output keys.
			Make sure the keys that show up in the password tester match the ones that are produced by your implementation.
			<br>
			Once both keys are generated, the content file should be encrypted with this schema:
			<br>
			<center>
				<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='docs/encrypt_scheme.png') }}">
			</center>
			<ol>
				<li>With a random number generator of your choice (a secure one is probably best) generate a 16-byte sequence for your initialization vector</li>
				<li>Using the client key and IV, encrypt the content file with AES in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.</li>
				<li>Prepend the 16 IV bytes to the encrypted content file so that they are the first 16 bytes of the file</li>
			</ol>
			After all this is done, send the vessel image, server key, and encrypted content to the insert API fuction.
			Upon success you will get a response with a link to an image on the website.  This image will have the encrypted content file embedded inside.
